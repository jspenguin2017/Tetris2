Description:
We re-created the classic arcade game Tetris, it has one-player and two-player
modes.
One-player mode is pretty much the classic Tetris game that you expect.
X-axis of the joystick moves the block, y-axis rotates, pressing the joystick
button drops the block faster.
In two-player mode, two players compete to complete rows in order to send
non-removable rows to their opponent, the player who ran out of space first
loses.
In two-players mode, players must wait for both Arduinos to be ready before
starting.

Components:
1x Arduino Mega 2560 board
1x Adafruit ILI9341 Breakout Board
1x Joystick
Enough wires

Wiring:
For the joystick and the display, use the same wiring instructions as
assignment 2, they are available on <redacted>.
The only difference is that the Arduino should be held in the position
where the screen is on the top instead of right (check "Two Players Setup.jpg").
For two-player mode, connect TX3 of the first Arduino to RX3 of the second,
then TX3 of the second Arduino to RX3 of the first, and last, connect GND of
the two Arduinos together.
Analog pin 15 must be unconnected (for either mode).

Compiling:
Use the makefile.
